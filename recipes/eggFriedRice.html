        <p>A nice 20 minute meal using leftover rice. Very scrumpdidlyumptious and would consume again.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Large eggs</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons peanut, vegetable, or olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup diced onion</li>
            <li>1 1/2 to 2 cups diced mixed vegetables</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sliced scallions</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
            <li>4 cups cooked overnight jasmine rice</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon five-spice powder</li>
            <li>dash of ground white pepper</li>
            <li>1 to 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Crack the eggs into a small bowl and beat them together.</li>
            <li>Heat a skillet with 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot,
                add the beaten eggs and scramble them for about a minute. Transfer the eggs to a dish
                and turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil into a wok over high heat. Add the onion
                and cook them for about 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the mixed vegetables
                and white part of the scallions and cook for 2 minutes. Season the vegetables with a
                pinch of salt.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked rice into the pan or wok and cook for several minutes, until the rice is 
                heated through. If there are large clumps of rice, break them apart with the back of your
                spatula.</li>
            <li>Add the soy sauce, five-spiced powder, dash of white pepper (if using) and sesame oil and 
                stir to distrubute the seasonings. Add the scrambled eggs and stir to mix again. Garnish 
                with remaining sliced scallions. Server immediately.

        </ol>
